    year: 2015 - 2017
    location: China
    items:
    - 'Proposed a framework with container auto-scaler, which monitors the resource usage of the containers and the associated scales in or scales out containers in need'
    - 'Defined a measurable cloud elasticity by providing executable analysis on the elastic performance of container- based autoscaling'
    - 'The first work to quantify the cloud elasticity with container-baised auto-scaling and it has been accepted as a full IEEE research paper and extended in a SCI journal with the total citation of 23 so far'
  - title: 'A Night Image Enhancement Algorithm Based on Guided Filtering'
    year: 2015
    location: China
    items:
    - 'Developed an extremely fast processing image method based on guilded flitering in order to make the original blurred and noisy nigh image clear and more suitable for human eys to observe'
    - 'Details are clearly presented and noises are successfully obliterated through processing the night image’s two layers independently which are separated in the HVS color space'
    - 'Guided filtering is used for the night image enhancement for the first time and a paper was published on the basis of the finding'
